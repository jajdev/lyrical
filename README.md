# lyrical
This is the implementation of an algorithm to sort and track song lyrics. The project will feature an implementation of a RadixSort using a Radix Tree (or N-ary Tree).

## v1.0
Finish implementing the original code from 2017 including the Radix Tree. Read in a txt file with lyrics from a single song. (Work In Progress)

## v2.0
Create a more robust dataset with various songs across genres. (Out of Scope)

## v3.0
Potential integration with Musixmatch, a third party developer that Spotify uses for their lyrical displays. More info at https://developer.musixmatch.com/documentation (Out of Scope)
